Flood-It
========

My implementation of the game Flood-It

Your goal is to make all of the colored boxes the same color using the minimum number of moves.
You do so by building a 'cluster' starting from the upper left. 
Pressing a number key from 1 to 6 changes your cluster to that color and all 
adjacent boxes of that color are then added to your cluster as well. 
Thus, your cluster grows over time until it encompasses the whole board.
If this sounds confusing don't worry. Just give it a whirl -- the game is very intuitive!
